Terminally di˜erentiated somatic cells are considered to be stable. However, pluripotency can be achieved by 
transplanting the nuclei of frog somatic cells into eggs
1. Furthermore, induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells can be 
generated by forced expression of speci˚c transcription factors
2. A recent study showed that pluripotent stem cells 
can also be generated from mouse somatic cells by using a cocktail of small-molecule compounds

8. Previously, we demonstrated that 
lactic acid bacteria incorporation into human dermal ˚broblasts (HDFs) altered cellular fate and could di˜er
-entiate into cells of all three germ layers
9. Cell fate has been reported to be a˜ected by microbiota: leprosy bacilli 
were observed to expand their infection by hijacking cellular reprogramming
10, and the gut microbiota controls 
the development of neural glia in the host intestine
11. Bacteria have been shown to a˜ect human cellular di˜er
-entiation, but the developmental e˜ect of bacteria remains unclear because the bacterium-intrinsic transforming 
factors that covert somatic cells into cells that can di˜erentiate into the three germ layers have not been identi˚ed.
In general, ribosomes are thought to function as the translational machinery in all organisms, but were 
recently been reported to control tumorigenesis, immune signaling, and development
12. The phenomenon 
of a single protein in ribosome having a plurality of functions in addition to its original function is known as 

‚moonlighting™
13,14. Here, we report the di˜erentiation of ribosome-induced cell clusters (RICs), dedi˜erentiated 
from the somatic cells, into the derivatives of the three germ-layer cells. Ribosomes were incorporated into cells 

through trypsin-activated endocytosis and generated cell clusters that were similar to embryoid bodies. ˝e RICs 

expressed pluripotency markers and di˜erentiated into cells derived from all three germ lineages upon condi
-tional cultivation, although the phenotypes of cell growth, epigenetic demethylation, and teratoma and chimera 
formation di˜ered from those of pluripotent stem cells. Furthermore, we demonstrated that these RICs impeded 
cell proliferation, similar to the ribosomal stress known as the starvation response
15
. Our data reveal unantici
-pated developmental plasticity of somatic cells conferred by universally present intrinsic ribosomes and a previ
-ously unknown avenue for acquiring stemness through communication between cells and bacteria.
Results

We hypothesized that cell-cluster formation 
and lineage transdi˜erentiation activity were closely linked because embryonic stem cells, iPS cells, and bacteri
-
ally reprogrammed cells clustered in the dedi˜erentiated state
16,17. We prepared a 
Lactobacillus acidophilus
 cell 
lysate, mixed the lysate with trypsinized HDFs, and plated the cells on normal cell-culture plates, which resulted 

in the formation of speci˚c cell clusters (Fig.˙
1a). Subsequently, we found that the
 ˜100-kDa fraction obtained 
from ultra˚ltration of the lysate induced cell cluster formation (Fig.˙
1b). Next, we fractionated the 
L. acidophilus
 lysate by column chromatography (Fig.˙
1c) and analyzed the peak fraction showing the highest activity (arrow; 
Fraction 21 (F21)) and the preceding low-activity fraction (dashed arrow; F20) by comparative liquid chroma
-
tography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS). No molecules larger than 100
 kDa were identi˚ed as single 
proteins among the 35 proteins speci˚cally enriched and/or more highly enriched in F21 than in F20 (Table˙S1). 

˝us, we predicted that the transdi˜erentiation factor existed as a large complex and that the ribosome, which 

has a molecular mass of 2.7
 MDa
18, was the candidate transdi˜erentiation material; accordingly, we identi˚ed 8 
ribosomal proteins. We could not ˚nd a protein that forms a protein complex exceeding 100
 kDa in the list, as far 
as we know.
To verify that the ribosome functions as a cell-cluster-inducing factor and determine whether this phenom
-enon is caused only by ribosomes isolated from 
L. acidophilus
 (L-ribosomes), we puri˚ed L-ribosomes and sev
-eral other types of ribosomes by conventional ultracentrifugation and then applied the L-ribosomes to HDFs as 
described above; all ribosomes induced substantial cell-cluster formation (Fig.˙
1d). Moreover, to demonstrate that 
cell-cluster formation was not caused by a contaminant derived from the centrifugal puri˚cation of ribosomes, we 

puri˚ed whole His6-tagged ribosomes (His-ribosomes) from genetically modi˚ed 
Escherichia coli
 JE28 cells
19 by 
aˆnity chromatography. ˝e puri˚ed His-ribosomes were applied to the HDFs as described above; this treatment 

also induced cell-cluster formation (Fig.˙
1d,e
 and Video˙S1). Furthermore, we found that cell clusters induced 
by ribosomes isolated from 
L. acidophilus, Staphylococcus epidermis
, Saccharomyces cerevisiae
, Rattus norvegi
-cus
, and 
E. coli
 JE28 were transformed into adipocytes when cultivated in di˜erentiation media (Fig.˙S1aŒf). It 
was reported that mesenchymal like stem cells and also few of HDFs possess di˜erentiation activity to adipo
-cyte, osteocyte and chondrocyte from mesenchymal like stem cells populations
20,21. We demonstrated that HDF 
without ribosome treatment does not have di˜erentiation activity to adipocytes, chondrocytes, cardiomyocytes 

and neurons under our culture conditions (Fig.˙S1gŒm). Lastly, we tested commercially available ribosomes, 

supplied with 
in vitro
 translation kits, to con˚rm their e˜ect on cellular transdi˜erentiation (Fig.˙
1f); these ribo
-somes also induced cell-cluster formation and the subsequent di˜erentiation of the clustered cells into adipocytes, 
osteocytes, and chondrocytes. ˝ese results indicate that treatment of HDFs with ribosomes can induce several 
lineage-transformable cell clusters, and that this e˜ect is independent of the phylogenetic relationship and struc
-
tural variety of the ribosomes.

We previ
-ously reported that cell-cluster formation did not occur in the absence of trypsin treatment
9, and trypsin diges
-tion was also reported to activate endocytosis in pancreatic acinar cells
22; however, the e˜ect of trypsinization 
on HDFs is unknown. We compared RIC formation conditions and visualized His-ribosomes. No signals were 

observed from normal HDFs (Fig.˙
2a). HDFs to which His-ribosomes were added without trypsinization also 
showed no His-ribosome signals (Fig.˙
2b). Only trypsinized HDFs supplemented with His-ribosomes formed 
RICs (Fig.˙
2c), and abundant ribosome incorporation was measured in these RICs (Fig.˙
2e). ˝ese data indicate 
that ribosome incorporation is activated by trypsinization and that incorporation of ribosomes is necessary for 

cell-cluster formation.
To determine how HDFs incorporate ribosomes, we tested the e˜ects of the following endocytosis inhibitors: 
˚lipin (FP), nystatin (NS), genistein (GS), cytochalasin B (CC), ba˚lomycin A1 (BM), concanamycin A (CM), 

5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl)-amiloride (5EA), chlorpromazine (CP), and methyl-
˚-cyclodextrin (M
˚CD) (Fig.˙
2f
 and Fig.˙S2). We found that FP, NS, GS, CC, BM, CM, and 5EA inhibited the formation of RICs, but we could not 

determine the e˜ect of CP because it was highly cytotoxic. Unexpectedly, M
˚CD drastically enhanced ribosome

-itor treatments was not due to reduced cell viability because we observed that almost all inhibitors that signi˚
-cantly reduced numbers of RICs at the concentrations at which cell viability was not a˜ected (Fig.˙
2f and Fig.˙S2). 
Next, to con˚rm the activation of endocytotic incorporation by trypsinization, we used microˇuorobeads and 

found that these beads were potently incorporated into trypsinized cells (Fig.˙
2g). Finally, we observed RICs by 
confocal microscopy at the highest magni˚cation available, and the obtained 3D image stacks clearly revealed 

that His-ribosomes were incorporated into the cytoplasmic and nuclear regions (Fig.˙
2h,i and Video˙S2). ˝us, 
our results indicate that ribosomes are incorporated into the cytoplasmic and nuclear areas of HDFs through 

trypsin-activated endocytosis, which is critical for RIC formation.

-tigated the potency of stemness against pluripotent stem cell classi˚cations
23. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis 
revealed that NANOG, a stem cell gateway factor
24, was expressed in RICs (Fig.˙
3c), and immunocytochemistry 
revealed that NANOG and the pluripotent transcription factors POU5F1 (OCT4), SOX2, and SSEA4 were specif
-ically expressed in RICs in a mosaic pattern (Fig.˙
3dŒh, Figs˙S3, S4). ˝e results of transcriptome analysis showed 
that the expression involved in somatic stem-cell maintenance was altered in L-ribosome-induced cell clusters 

compared to the expression in non-induced HDFs (Fig.˙S5). Although NANOG was expressed in RICs, demeth
-ylation in the NANOG promoter was not observed (Fig.˙S6). Abnormal karyotype, that cause proliferation and 
pluripotency failure, is observed in about 12% of pluripotent stem cells
25. We analyzed copy number variation to 
investigate the karyotype (Fig.˙S7), which indicated that a polymorphism was present in the 572-kb-long region 

of chromosome 17q21.31, although no other variants and chromosomal replications were detected.
We also investigated the expression diversity of His-ribosome-induced RICs in a single-cell qPCR assay with 10 
stem cell primer pairs
26 (Fig.˙
3i). ˝e 99 cell expression patterns showed that stemness was heterogenous in the cell 
cluster. We also performed single cell transcription for the pluripotency markers and compared RICs population and 

normal HDFs (Fig.˙S8). Expression level diversity of the RICs population were highly diverse compared to normal 

HDFs. Some cells in RICs were indicated strong expression of the pluripotency makers. To elucidate how RICs alter 

their stemness, we performed RNA-seq analysis on days 0, 2, 5, 8, 11, and 14 a˛er His-ribosome treatment. We com
-pared the expression patterns with RICs and other types of pluripotent stem cells
27. Principal component analysis 
showed that the RIC state di˜ered from that of control HDF and that RICs formed clusters in di˜erent positions 
from conventional iPS cells and ES cells (Fig.˙
3j). RICs state was stable a˛er 8 days of ribosomes treatment. RICs 
altered the expression of cellular adhesion- and extracellular matrix-related genes (Table˙S2). ˝ese results indicate 

that ribosomes stimulate cellular dedi˜erentiation and induce stemness marker expression in cell clusters.

in vitroNext, we performed 
in vitro
 dif-ferentiation assays and found that RICs di˜erentiated into ectodermal neurons (transformation eˆciency: 64%) 

(Fig.˙
4aŒc), mesodermal cardiomyocytes (transformation eˆciency: 22%) (Fig.˙
4d,e
), and endodermal hepato
-cytes (transformation eˆciency: 66%) (Fig.˙
4f,g
). To evaluate 
in vivo
 tumor formation, we transplanted human 
RICs into a total of 6 testes of immunode˚cient mice and observed no teratoma formation at 3 months (Fig.˙
4h).We applied His-ribosomes to mouse embryonic ˚broblasts (MEFs) and found that MEFs also formed cell 
clusters (Fig.˙
4i) and di˜erentiated into oil-producing cells (Fig.˙
4j), indicating a hepatocyte phenotype
28. We 
performed 8 trials of chimera formation assays with RICs generated from MEFs, and all 8 trials failed to indicate 

a contribution of RICs to the embryo under the conditions used in this study (data not shown). Collectively, our 

results show that ribosome treatment was e˜ective in human and mouse cells and that RICs di˜erentiated into 

the three germ-layer cells

impaired cell proliferation.
Treatment of HDFs with ribosomes immediately induced cell migration and cluster formation (Video˙S3a,b). 
˝e RICs were produced through cell aggregation, and cell division had clearly stopped in the RICs. To determine 
whether the RICs were undergoing apoptosis or cell proliferation arrest, we performed immunocytochemical 
analysis for the apoptosis marker single-stranded DNA, which revealed a low level of apoptosis (Fig.˙
5a). We also 
performed immunocytochemistry for the cell cycle markers CDC27 and 
˚-tubulin, which showed mosaic stain
-ing patterns in RICs (Fig.˙
5b,c
). Next, we analyzed the cell cycle in live RICs by cellular redox staining
29, which 
indicated that the ratio of S/G2 phase cells was higher in RICs than in control HDFs (Fig.˙
5d). Finally, RICs gen
-erated from Fucci2-expressing MEFs showed mosaic patterns of cell clusters and an enrichment of S/G2M phase 

cells (Fig.˙
5e
 and Video˙S4a,b). Taken together, these results demonstrate that the cell cycle is not synchronized 
and that cell cycle progression is not arrested in RICs, indicating a state similar to ribosomal stress
30.˝e epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is known to play a role in embryonic development by trans
-forming epithelial cells into mesenchymal cells, accompanied by a loss of cell adhesiveness
31. Because of alter
-ations in cell adhesion and the acquisition of di˜erentiation ability into the three germ cell layers, similar to 

mesenchymal cells, we next compared the expression patterns of EMT markers in RICs and normal HDFs by 

immunocytochemistry (Fig.˙
5fŒo). We found that the E-cadherin expression pattern did not change (Fig.˙
5f,g
), 
although vimentin expression was changed in RICs (Fig.˙
5h,i). TWIST1, a regulator of morphogenesis and stem 
cell proliferation
32,33, is expressed in RICs but not in HDFs (Fig.˙
5j,k,n,o
), whereas the major EMT regulator 
SNAIL1 was not expressed in both cells (Fig.˙
5l,m,n,o
). ˝ese data indicate that ribosomal treatment of HDFs 
a˜ects expression of the EMT regulators vimentin and TWIST1 in RICs.

transdi˜erentiation by bacteria described previously was cell-type independent, indicating that a general underly
-
ing mechanism exists for lineage conversion by bacteria
34. In this study, we found that ribosomes induce somatic 
cell transdi˜erentiation to restricted-multipotent cells. ˝is can occur via donor bacteria that are swallowed and 

digested by host cells, which may induce ribosomal stress and stimulate cellular developmental plasticity.
Eubacteria are thought to have infected archaebacteria, a˛er which genomic DNA was transferred between 
cells, resulting in the evolution of cells
35. Recently, ribosomal proteins were reported to control not only protein 
translation, but also cellular proliferation and di˜erentiation
36,37. We suggest that ribosomal lineage conversion 
is involved in multicellular development by examining external organisms; other examples include cytoplasmic 

incompatibility caused by Wolbachia
38, endophytic plantŒmicrobe interactions
39, and acquisition of chloroplasts 
and mitochondria through symbiogenesis
40.Our study showed that pluripotency marker NANOG and OCT4 was induced by ribosome incorporation and 
transfer cellular state that to be able to induce neuronal, muscle and hepatic cells marker expressed cells by 
in vitro
 culture. Unlike conventional pluripotent stem cells, expression of pluripotent markers in some of RICs consisting 

cells were few and failed to lead functional cell di˜erentiation, teratoma formation, and chimeric mice generation. 
During iPS cell generation, pluripotent intermediate cells decreased in cell volume and underwent proliferation 
arrest
41. Moreover, when a chemical approach involving small molecules was employed to reprogram mouse 
somatic cells into pluripotent stem cells, the cells passed through an extraembryonic endoderm-like state during 

completion of pluripotency
42; incubation for 40 days with chemically de˚ned factors caused the cells to transition 
from the extraembryonic endoderm-like state into pluripotent stem cells. ˝us, it will be particularly interesting 

to extend the culture duration and investigate the molecular roadmap underlying ribosomal lineage transdi˜er
-entiation, which leads to a higher potential for developmental ability.
Based on global expression analysis, RICs alter cellular pluripotency, which di˜ers from conventional pluripo
-tent stem cells. In OCT4 and NANOG double-stained cells, we detected highly demethylated sequences in RICs 

and various gene expression patterns of pluripotent markers. PCA analysis by RNA-seq showed the RICs state 

is maturated at day 8 a˛er ribosomes incorporation. ˝is suggests that RICs aggregate and show heterogenous 

stemness. As described for iPS cell generation, elite or stochastic models of acquisition pluripotency have been 

evaluated previously
43,44. Improvement in the expression of pluripotency markers and focused analysis of pluri
-potent cells will reveal whether the elite or stochastic model is better for RIC formation.
˝e EMT is essential for embryonic development, although it induces ˚brosis and carcinoma generation
45,46. We observed expression of EMT regulators in ribosome-induced cell clusters; however, it remains unclear 

whether cellular regulation and function were a˜ected by the HDF phenotype. Because ribosomal transdi˜eren
-
tiation is simple 
in vitro
, we will focus on cancer cell transdi˜erentiation to investigate cancer cell plasticity and 
develop new therapeutics. Cellular lineage transdi˜erentiation of cancer cell lines can be conducted to under
-stand the bivalent phase of EMT between development and carcinogenesis.
Cellular transdi˜erentiation by ribosomes was achieved by trypsin digestion-activated endocytosis without 
genetic modi˚cation. ˝e ribosome is a very large cellular component that can be isolated by centrifugation; 

thus, cellular transdi˜erentiation can be performed using the cells™ own ribosomes. ˝ese ˚ndings can be applied 

in regenerative medicine to avoid genetic modi˚cations and immunogenic reactions. Furthermore, for 
in vivo
 transdi˜erentiation, this method can be applied to translocate ribosomes to a targeted area by using a bacterial 

vehicle
47,48.Although Waddington™s epigenetic concept is widely supported as the cause of hierarchical restrictions and 
robustness of cell di˜erentiation during normal development, other mechanisms for overcoming cascade barri
-
ers to accommodate transdi˜erentiation and cellular reprogramming have been proposed
49. Currently, cellular 
reprogramming through nuclear transfer into oocytes and the use of extrinsic stimuli such as transcription fac
-
tors or small molecules is widely accepted; thus, future analysis of ribosomal transdi˜erentiation will provide a 

unique model for cellular lineage plasticity.

bu˜ers (Fig.˙S9). ˝e method was described in the section ﬁcell cluster assayﬂ and used dissolving bu˜ers, PBS 

(Fig.˙S9a; control for Fig.˙
1a,b), TD (Fig.˙S9b. control for Fig.˙
1c) were used. No cluster was formed.

Prokaryotic ribosomes were puri˚ed by ultracentrifugation, as previously 
reported
52. Brieˇy, a 1% volume of pre-cultured solutions (stationary-phase bacteria) was inoculated into new 
culture medium and incubated until the cells reached the late-stationary phase. ˝e cultured cells were imme
-diately chilled, collected by centrifugation, and washed with TMA-I bu˜er (10
 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 30
 mM 
NH4Cl, 10
 mM MgCl
2, and 6
 mM 2-mercaptoethanol). All further operations were performed at 4
 °C. ˝e har
-vested cells were suspended in TMA-I bu˜er and disrupted by sonication. Cell debris was removed by centrifug
-
ing the suspension at 10,000
 ˇ g, and the supernatant was collected and centrifuged at 158,000
 ˇ g for 30
 min; the 
obtained supernatant was collected and centrifuged at 116,000
 ˇ g for 6
 h. ˝e sediment was dissolved in 1
 mL of 
TMA-I and layered on 30% sucrose containing TMA-I, and the tube was centrifuged at 158,000
 ˇ g for 15
 h. ˝e 
sucrose-cushion-puri˚ed 70
 S ribosome precipitate was dissolved in TMA-I supplemented with 10% glycerol and 
rapidly chilled in liquid nitrogen. ˝e samples were stored at 
˘80 °C.To purify eukaryotic ribosomes, ultracentrifugation was performed as described previously
53. Brieˇy, cell pel

355,040 ˇ g (TLA120.2; Beckman-Coulter, Brea, CA, USA) for 60
 min. ˝e sucrose-cushion-puri˚ed precipitate 
was dissolved in HMK bu˜er, aliquoted, and chilled in liquid nitrogen. ˝e samples were stored at 
˘80 °C.Tetra-(His)6-tagged ribosomes isolated from 
E. coli
 JE28 were a kind gi˛ from Dr. Ederth; the His-ribosomes 
were puri˚ed as described previously
19. For aˆnity puri˚cation, a cOmplete His-tag puri˚cation column (Roche 
Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany) was used with the AKTAprime chromatography system following the 

protocols described by the manufacturer and Ederth 
et al
.To analyze the activity of commercial ribosomes, we purchased ribosomes included in an 
in vitro
 protein 
expression system, PUREfrex 2.0 (PF201-0.2; GeneFrontier, Chiba, Japan).
To inhibit bacterial ribosomal translation, 50
 ˜g/mL gentamicin (Sigma-Aldrich; St. Louis, MO, USA) was 
added to the cell culture medium.

For immunocytochemistry, cell clusters were ˚xed with 4% paraformaldehyde 
for 15
 min at room temperature (RT), washed with PBS, and treated with PBS containing 5% heat-inactivated 
goat serum and 0.1% Triton X-100 for 30
 min at RT. ˝e clusters were incubated with primary antibody over
-night at 4
 °C at the following dilutions: anti-OCT4 (1:200, R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA, MAB1759), 
anti-OCT4A (for Fig.˙S4, 1:200, Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA, USA); #2840), anti-NANOG (1:150, 
Abcam (Cambridge, UK); ab21624), anti-TRA-1-60 (1:100, Molecular Probes, Sunnyvale, CA, USA, A24868),

and anti-CDC27 (1:100, BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA), 610454). Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated phal
-loidin was purchased from ˝ermo Fisher Scienti˚c, Inc. A˛er 3 washes with PBS, the sections were incubated 
for 3
 hours at RT with an anti-mouse IgG or IgM antibody conjugated with Cy3 or ˇuorescein isothiocyanate 
(FITC) (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA, USA), anti-rabbit IgG antibody conjugated with Cy3 or 
FITC (GE Healthcare), or anti-rat IgG or IgG antibody conjugated with Cy3 or FITC (Jackson ImmunoResearch); 

4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) was included in the antibody dilutions. Images were constructed using 
ImageJ so˛ware (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA). Hepatocyte formation was identi˚ed using an antibody against 

the human hepatic cell marker Hnf4
ˆ (1:200; Cell Signalling, 3113). Fluorescence images were captured using 
a BioRevo BZ-9000 microscope (Keyence, Osaka, Japan) and FV1200 confocal microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, 

Japan). Signals from the secondary antibody without the primary antibody were not detected (negative control; 

Fig.˙S4).

In vitro
 assays for cell di˜erentiation into adipocytes, chondrocytes, and 
osteoblasts were performed as previously described
9 by using StemPro
Ž Adipogenesis Di˜erentiation Kit (cat 
No. A1007001, ˝ermo Fisher Scienti˚c, Inc.), StemPro
Ž Chondrogenesis Di˜erentiation Kit (cat No. A1007101, 
˝ermo Fisher Scienti˚c, Inc.) and StemPro
Ž Osteogenesis Di˜erentiation Kit (cat No. A1007201 ˝ermo Fisher 
Scienti˚c, Inc.). Neural induction of RICs was performed using the Human ES/iPS Neurogenesis Kit (Millipore, 

Billerica, MA, USA). Brieˇy, RICs were cultured with Neural Induction Medium 1 (NIM1) containing GSK3, 

TGF
˚R, and AMPK inhibitors and the medium was changed to fresh NIM1 medium every other day for 5 days. 
Next, RICs were cultured with Neural Induction Medium 2 (NIM2) containing GSK3 and TGF
˚R inhibitors and 

the medium was changed to fresh NIM2 medium every other day for an additional 5 days. Finally, RICs were cul
-
tured with Neural Di˜erentiation Medium containing adenosine 3
,5
-cyclic monophosphate, N6, O2
-dibutyryl-, 
sodium salt, and ascorbic acid 2-phosphate and the medium was changed to fresh medium every other day for 

14 days.
RICs were also differentiated into cardiomyocytes by using the pluripotent stem cells Cardiomyocyte 
Di˜erentiation Kit (˝ermo Fisher Scienti˚c, Inc.). Brieˇy, RICs were cultured on multi-well plates coated with 
Geltrex
TM
 (˝ermo Fisher Scienti˚c, Inc.) with Essential 8
TM
 Medium and the medium was changed to fresh 
Essential 8
TM
 Medium every other day for 3 days. Next, the culture medium was changed to Cardiomyocyte 
Differentiation Medium A containing BMP/activin activator and GSK3 inhibitor. After 2 days, the culture 
medium was changed to Cardiomyocyte Di˜erentiation Medium B containing Wnt inhibitor and the medium 

was changed to fresh Cardiomyocyte Di˜erentiation Medium B every other day for an additional 6 days.
RICs were di˜erentiated into hepatocytes as previously escribed
54. Brieˇy, mature HDFs, MEFs, and RICs 
were placed in hepatocyte di˜erentiation basal medium containing 2
 ˜M tauroursodeoxycholic acid; a˛er incu
-bation for 21 days, during which half of the medium was replaced every 2Œ3 days, the cells were subjected to 

immunostaining or Oil Red O staining.
˝e eˆciency of transformation from RICs to di˜erentiated cells was calculated by counting of marker-stained 
cells and calculating the ratio relative to the number of non-stained cells surrounding the RICs.

Cell cycle progression was measured in live cells by using a CellClock assay kit (Biocolor 
Inc., Carrickfergus, UK) according to the manufacturer™s protocols. A˛er 14 days of culture, RICs were analyzed 

using ImageJ so˛ware
55. ˝resholds were set at 140Œ165 (dark blue; M phase), 166Œ185 (green; G1/S phase), and 
140Œ160 (yellow; G0/G1).
HDFs and MEFs were cultured with 
L. acidophilus
 ribosomes in PluriSTEM Human ES/iPS Medium (Merck), 
with half of the medium replaced every 2Œ3 days, and imaged using an IncuCyte ZOOM instrument (Essen 

BioScience, Ann Arbor, MI, USA). For imaging, we used the default so˛ware parameters for a 96-well plate with 
a 10ˇ objective.

We examined the cell clusters induced by 
His-ribosomes. A˛er 14 days of incubation, the RICs that appeared were stained with anti-6
ˇ His (ab18184; 
Abcam), Alexa Fluor 488 phalloidin, or Hoechst 33342 as described in the immunocytochemistry section above. 
˝e stained cells were observed and quanti˚ed on 96-well microclear-bottom microplates (No. 655090; Greiner, 

Greinerstraße, Austria). ˝e nucleus and cytoplasm were visualized from Hoechst 33342 and Alexa Fluor 488 
phalloidin ˇuorescence signals, respectively. For all samples, we examined 4 wells (n
 ˝ 4) and acquired 9 pho
-tographs per well by confocal stacking, and then quanti˚ed the signal intensity with an IN Cell Analyzer 6000 
imaging cytometer system (GE Healthcare). ˝e cytoplasm was de˚ned by the Alexa Fluor 488 phalloidin signal 

and the nucleus by the Hoechst 33342 signal.

All chemicals used for the inhibition assay are listed in Table˙S4 and were 
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Because the endocytosis inhibitors were cytotoxic, cell viability assays for HDFs 

were performed using the thiazolyl blue tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay following the manufacturer™s protocol 

(Sigma-Aldrich). HDFs were seeded at 2
 ˇ 104 cells/well in 96-well plates together with 10
 ˜g of ribosomes iso
-lated from 
L. acidophilus
. Cell clusters were counted a˛er incubation for 24
 h. All assays were conducted 4 times 
and the scores were analyzed using Student™s t test. ˝e microˇuorobead incorporation assay was performed using 

50-nm-diameter microˇuorobeads (Polysciences, Warrington, PA, USA) as previously described
56.11
Images of cultured cells were recorded under 
a confocal microscope (A1; Nikon, Tokyo, Japan). ˝e primary antibody for His-tagged ribosomes was anti-His 
tag antibody (Abcam, ab18184; 1:200), and the secondary antibody was Cy3-conjugated anti mouse-IgG antibody 

(Jackson ImmunoResearch, 115-165-166, 1:200).
˝e following is a list of instrument parts and settings used in this study. Laser lines at 405 and 561
 nm 
were used for excitation of DAPI and Cy3, respectively. An oil-immersion objective lens (Apo TIRF 100
ˇ Oil, 
NA ˝ 1.49; Nikon) was used to capture high-magni˚cation images. ˝e pixel size of the confocal images was set 
to 30
 nm. ˝e pinhole size was set to 0.3Œ0.6
 AU. To enhance the resolution, confocal images were deconvolved 
by using NIS-Elements C-ER so˛ware (Nikon) in some cases. All images were recorded at RT (25.5
 °C  0.5 °C).
Total RNA for microarray analysis was extracted from RICs and control HDFs 
a˛er 14 days of culture; we used TRIzol reagent (˝ermo Fisher Scienti˚c Inc.) with 1.0-mm glass beads (BSP-

11079110W, WAKENBTECH, Shiga, Japan), a KONTES Homogenizer pestle (Kimble Chase, Vineland, NJ, 

USA), and a ReliaPrep RNA Cell Miniprep System (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) for puri˚cation. RNA quality 

was assessed using a Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). To generate Cy3-labeled cRNA, 
total RNA (150
 ng) was reverse-transcribed using a Low-Input Quick Amp Labeling Kit, one-color (Agilent 
Technologies). ˝e cRNA was fragmented and hybridized to the SurePrint G3 Human Gene Expression 8
 ˇ 60 K v2 chip (Agilent Technologies) according to the manufacturer™s protocol, with 3 technical replicates used for each 
cell type. Microarray chips were scanned using a DNA Microarray Scanner (Agilent Technologies). Microarray 

data were feature-extracted using Agilent Feature Extraction so˛ware (ver. 11.5.1.1). Microarray intensities were 

intra- and inter-array normalized using Limma package version 3.14.4
57 in the R statistical computing environ
-ment. For visualization using heatmaps, normalized microarray intensities for each gene were further represented 

as z-scores among all cell types (Fig.˙S5). Information for gene function categories such as ﬁsomatic stem cell 

maintenanceﬂ was extracted from the Gene Ontology Database
58.Total RNA for RNA-seq analysis was extracted on days 0, 2, 5, 8, 11, and 14 a˛er ribosome treatment of HDF 
clusters. RNA extraction and quality evaluation procedures were the same as those used for microarray analysis. 

RNA-seq library construction and sequencing were performed by Filgen (Nagoya, Japan). Brieˇy, Sequencing 

libraries were generated using NEBNext
® Ultra
Ž RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina
® (NEB, USA) following 
manufacturer™s recommendations and index codes were added to attribute sequences to each sample. mRNA 

was puri˚ed from total RNA using poly-T oligo-attached magnetic beads. Fragmentation was carried out using 

divalent cations under elevated temperature in NEBNext First Strand Synthesis Reaction Bu˜er (5
ˇ). First strand 
cDNA was synthesized using random hexamer primer and M-MuLV Reverse Transcriptase (RNase H
˘). Second 
strand cDNA synthesis was subsequently performed using DNA Polymerase I and RNase H. Remaining over
-hangs were converted into blunt ends via exonuclease/polymerase activities. A˛er adenylation of 3
 ends of DNA 

fragments, NEBNext Adaptor with hairpin loop structure were ligated to prepare for hybridization. In order to 

select cDNA fragments of preferentially 250Œ300
 bp in length, the library fragments were puri˚ed with AMPure 
XP system (Beckman Coulter, Beverly, USA). ˝en 3
 ˜l USER Enzyme (NEB, USA) was used with size-selected, 
adaptor-ligated cDNA at 37
 °C for 15
 min followed by 5
 min at 95
 °C before PCR. ˝en PCR was performed with 
Phusion High-Fidelity DNA polymerase, Universal PCR primers and Index (X) Primer. At last, PCR products 

were puri˚ed (AMPure XP system) and library quality was assessed on the Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 system. 

Sequencing was performed on Illumina HiSeq. 4000 with RTA version 2.7.7 so˛ware for base calling.
RNA-seq data were ˚ltered using the following criteria: (1) remove reads containing adapters; (2) remove 
reads containing N
 ˜ 10%, where N represents a base that cannot be determined; (3) remove reads contain
-ing low-quality (Qscore
  5) bases accounting for more than 50% of the total bases. Next, RNA-seq reads were 
mapped to the human transcriptome using Tophat2 program version 2.1.1
59; the genes.gtf ˚le in the Illumina 
iGenome hg19 was used for transcriptome annotation. ˝e number of reads mapped for each gene was counted 

using HTSeq package version 0.7.2
60. Di˜erentially expressed genes between days 0 and 14 (false-discovery 
rate
 ˛ 0.05) were detected using edgeR package version 3.16.5
61, and GO enrichment analysis was performed 
using the DAVID web server version 6.8
62. For principal component analysis, read counts were transformed into 
counts per million and then log2-transformed. To compare our RIC data and the ESCs/iPSCs data from Ma 
et al.27, batch e˜ects were corrected using ComBat program in SVA package version 3.22.0
63 so that HDFs from the 
both studies had concordant expression pro˚les.
˝e microarray data and the RNA-seq data were deposited in the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus database 
with the accession number GSE99089 (
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc
 ˝ GSE99089
).
iPS cells were generated from human adipose-derived mesenchy
-mal stem cells as described previously
64. Samples were run in triplicate and expression was normalized to the 
levels of human Rplp0 (36b4). ˝e samples were analyzed by qPCR performed using THUNDERBIRD SYBR 

qPCR Mix (TOYOBO, Osaka, Japan). Endogenous versus exogenous gene expression was quanti˚ed as previously 

reported
65. Statistical comparisons were performed using Student™s t test. Error bars indicate the mean
  SEM.
For single-cell analysis, day 14 RICs were digested by trypsin (Cell Applications, San Diego, CA, USA) for 
5 min at 37
 °C. Digested RICs were dissociated by 23
 G syringe pumping several times. Cells were passed through 
a 70 ˜m diameter cell strainer and clonally sorted into 96˘well PCR plates by BD FACS Aria II (BD Biosciences) 
with Hoechst-positive cells. First-strand cDNA was synthesized using CellsDirect One˘Step qRT˘PCR kits 
(˝ermo Fisher Scienti˚c, Inc.) and a Taqman probe and primer set for each gene (Table˙S5). ˝e cDNA was 
preampli˚ed by 20 cycles of PCR and real-time qPCR was performed in TaqMan Fast Advanced Master Mix (Life 

Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) with Taq man probes using the BioMark
TM HD system (Fluidigm, South San 
Francisco, CA, USA). Expression levels of RICs and HDFs were normalized by Gapdh expression. ˝e graph was

Genomic DNA was isolated by using a DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, 
Germany). Bisul˚te conversion of genomic DNA was performed using a MethylEasyXeed Kit (TAKARA, Shiga, 
Japan) and the product was immediately ampli˚ed by using EpiTaq HS (TAKARA) with OCT4, NANOG, and 

LMNA primer pairs, which are listed in Table˙S6. Sequence data were analyzed on the QUMA server in RIKEN 

CDB
67.
Genomic DNA was extracted from cell clusters using 
a DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit (Qiagen). ˝e quality and quantity of genomic DNA were assessed using the Qubit 

Fluorometric Quanti˚cation assay kit (˝ermo Fisher Scienti˚c, Inc.). Hybridization scanning, conducted by the 

Support Center for Advanced Medical Sciences, Institute of Biomedical Sciences, Tokushima University Graduate 

School, was performed on a Cytoscan HD array (A˜ymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA), which integrated
 ˜2.6 mil
-lion copy-number markers across the human genome. Scanning data from the A˜ymetrix GeneChip Command 

Console were analyzed using the Chromosome Analysis so˛ware suite (A˜ymetrix).

Teratoma formation was performed according to the guidelines of the Committee on 
Animal Research at the Kumamoto University. RICs were collected by collagenase IV treatment and injected into 

the testes of NOD-SCID immunode˚cient mice at 5
 ˇ 105 cells per testis
68. ˝e 6 testes were collected approxi
-mately 12Œ16 weeks a˛er injection and ˚xed in 10% formalin, and then processed for paraˆn embedding and 

hematoxylin-eosin staining following standard procedures.

Generation of mouse chimeras was approved by the 
Committee of RIKEN Kobe Branch, and performed in accordance with the RIKEN Kobe Branch animal experi
-
mentation guidelines. RICs derived from MEFs carrying the R26-H2B-EGFP reporter allele
69 were injected into 
host CD1 embryos at the 8-cell or blastocyst stage, which were then transferred to 2.5
 dpc pseudopregnant recip
-ients. Injected embryos were dissected at 9.5Œ11.5
 dpc, and chimerism was assessed based on the EGFP signal, 
representing the contribution of RICs, under a ˇuorescence stereoscope.
